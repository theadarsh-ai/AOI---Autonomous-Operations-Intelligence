Create a fully autonomous, self-operating AI system for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) using AWS Bedrock Agents as the core intelligence framework. The system must operate 24/7 without human intervention, predicting IT problems 24-48 hours before they occur and automatically executing preventive actions.

CORE ARCHITECTURE:
Build a multi-agent system using AWS Bedrock Agents with the following hierarchy:

1. MASTER ORCHESTRATOR AGENT (Bedrock Agent with Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Central command agent that coordinates all sub-agents
   - Maintains global state and decision context across the entire MSP operation
   - Routes tasks to specialized agents based on complexity and domain
   - Resolves conflicts between agent recommendations
   - Learns from all agent outcomes to improve orchestration logic
   - Action Groups: agent_coordination, priority_management, conflict_resolution, global_optimization

2. PREDICTIVE MONITORING AGENT (Bedrock Agent)
   - Continuously analyzes real-time metrics from RMM/PSA systems

AGENT ACTION GROUPS (Lambda Functions):
Each Bedrock Agent has 5-8 action groups (Lambda functions) that it can invoke autonomously:

Predictive Monitoring Agent Actions:
- analyze_system_metrics(system_id, timeframe) → risk_score
- predict_failure(metric_data, historical_patterns) → prediction_result
- calculate_business_impact(failure_type, client_id) → impact_assessment
- generate_preventive_recommendations(risk_data) → action_plan

Autonomous Decision Agent Actions:
- evaluate_action_approval(action_type, cost, impact) → approved/escalate
- execute_approved_decision(action_plan) → execution_status
- calculate_roi(preventive_cost, failure_cost) → roi_analysis
- log_decision_audit_trail(decision_data) → audit_id

Resource Optimization Agent Actions:
- find_optimal_technician(required_skills, availability, location) → technician_assignment
- optimize_maintenance_schedule(client_windows, urgency) → scheduled_time
- predict_resource_needs(workload_trends, growth_rate) → capacity_forecast
- balance_workload(team_capacity, ticket_queue) → assignment_plan

Client Lifecycle Agent Actions:
- automate_client_onboarding(client_data, services) → onboarding_workflow
- calculate_health_score(usage_metrics, satisfaction, tickets) → health_score

   - System baselines and normal behavior patterns
   - Failure signatures and resolution playbooks
   - Vendor documentation and troubleshooting guides

2. Client Intelligence Knowledge Base:
   - Client contracts, SLAs, and service agreements
   - Communication history and preferences
   - Success metrics and satisfaction scores
   - Industry-specific compliance requirements

3. Business Operations Knowledge Base:
   - Pricing models and profitability benchmarks
   - Resource utilization patterns
   - Financial forecasting models
   - Market intelligence and competitor analysis

4. Learning Repository Knowledge Base:
   - Decision history with outcomes
   - Agent performance metrics
   - Industry best practices
   - Continuous improvement patterns

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION RULES:
Define clear autonomy levels for each agent:

LEVEL 1 - FULL AUTONOMY (No human approval):
- Preventive maintenance scheduling (cost < $2K, downtime < 2hrs)
- Routine ticket routing and technician assignment
- Standard compliance remediation (low-risk vulnerabilities)
- Client notifications and status updates
- Resource reallocation within existing capacity
- Price adjustments within ±5% of baseline

LEVEL 2 - CONDITIONAL AUTONOMY (Auto-approve with notification):
- Preventive actions costing $2K-$10K
- Maintenance windows affecting multiple clients
- Service upgrades for existing clients (< 20% cost increase)
- Security remediations requiring brief downtime
- Contract renewals with standard terms

LEVEL 3 - HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP (Requires approval):
- Actions costing > $10K
- New client onboarding with custom requirements
- Contract negotiations outside standard parameters
- Major infrastructure changes
- Policy violations or unusual patterns

AUTONOMOUS LEARNING LOOP:
1. Every agent decision is logged with: context, action taken, predicted outcome, actual outcome
2. Learning Agent analyzes decision outcomes hourly
3. Successful patterns increase confidence thresholds (expand autonomy)
4. Failed patterns trigger model updates and threshold adjustments
5. Cross-agent learning: insights from one agent improve others
6. Weekly optimization: retrain prediction models with new data
7. Monthly evolution: Master Orchestrator updates coordination strategies

INTEGRATION PATTERN:
External System Event → EventBridge Rule → Lambda Preprocessor → Master Orchestrator Agent → Task Analysis → Route to Specialized Agent(s) → Agent uses Action Groups (Lambda) → Step Functions Workflow Execution → Update Knowledge Bases → Notify Stakeholders → Log Outcome → Learning Agent Updates Models

SUCCESS METRICS FOR AUTONOMY:
- 95% of decisions made without human intervention
- 80% problem prevention before client impact
- 24-48 hour prediction accuracy > 85%
- Decision execution time < 5 minutes (detection to action)
- False positive rate < 10%
- ROI positive on 90% of preventive actions
- Learning improvement: +2% accuracy per month

SAFETY & GUARDRAILS:
- Bedrock Guardrails prevent harmful or unauthorized actions
- Cost thresholds: automatic escalation for high-cost decisions
- Impact assessment: all actions evaluated for client disruption risk
- Rollback capability: Step Functions support automatic rollback on failures
- Human override: any autonomous decision can be vetoed in real-time
- Audit trail: complete decision history in CloudWatch and DynamoDB
- Testing sandbox: new agent behaviors tested before production deployment

Build this as a React frontend with real-time WebSocket connections to AWS AppSync, displaying:
- Agent activity dashboard (what each agent is currently doing)
- Autonomous decision log (live feed of auto-approved actions)
- Prediction timeline (upcoming issues detected and actions scheduled)
- Learning metrics (agent performance improvement over time)
- Financial impact tracker (savings from prevention, ROI by agent)

The system must operate completely autonomously for 95% of scenarios, only escalating to humans for high-risk or out-of-bounds decisions. Every component should be serverless, scalable, and fully AWS-native using Bedrock Agents as the intelligence layer.
